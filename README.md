DrawWiz
=======

This is the web version of the DrawWiz App (A relatively early version).

About
-----

This web app is about creating a virtual character by combining body parts. I made this project during an intern. It is an html port of the company's main project, DrawWiz, at that time. The mobile app have updated and I am not updating this project after the intern because of schoolwork. The webpage involves some html5 and css3 working together with javascript, and is designed to work on a mobile device(please adjust your browser's window size if you view it on desktop). 

Functions
---------

Major buttons:

* The drawer below changes the components of the character
* The top-left button changes the color of the currently active component
* The top-right buttom randomizes all components (does not affect color)

The main canvas can receive gestures:

* Single tap toggles the buttons and leaves you the character only
* Swiping left/right switches the current component
* Swiping up/down moves the component vertically

The HTML and my development process
-----------------------------------

The project was mainly created by myself, with the exception of all the artwork and the valuable helps from the DrawWiz team. It was practically the first time for me to explore and apply the features of html5 and css3, particularly the drawing and animation/transition part. It is also the first time I applied a webpage to a mobile browser and tried to make it act as an app - but without installation! The html5 and "light-app" really inspired me, and since then I have been striving to implement ideas using it/

Another notable point is that the debugging process covered more than 60% of the whole development period. It took me really a lot of effort to make a "usable" app to an actually "working" app - to achieve the smooth user experience. It was far beyond my estimation, because the prior projects I created for myself never required that perfection. But this actually reminded me that it is actually all the improvements that count - especially for a commercial product to win in the intense competition. The seek for perfection also guided my programming style after this intern. (However, there is still one big issue which the team and I failed to resolve: when running the page on iPhone's Safari with iOS7, the browser simply crash when rendering the canvas, and we did not find a workaround)

Although I'm no longer in the team, this project is kind of a milestone in my process of learning web development, so I decided to publish it on GitHub to mark this inspiring light-app.
