About
-----

This web app is about creating a virtual character by combining body parts. It is designed to run like an app in a mobile browser (portrait). Please adjust the window size if running on the desktop.

Functions
---------

Major buttons:

* The drawer below changes the components of the character
* The top-left button changes the color of the currently active component
* The top-right buttom randomizes all components (does not affect color)

The main canvas can receive gestures:

* Single tap toggles the buttons and leaves you the character only
* Swiping left/right switches the current component
* Swiping up/down moves the component vertically
